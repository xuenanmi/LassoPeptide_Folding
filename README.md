# Lasso Folding

This repository contains all the source code for analyzing the lasso folding molecular dynamics simulation data of 20 different lasso peptides.

## Features

- Featurization of MD trajectory data
- Construction and validation of Markov State Models (MSM)
- Thermodynamic and kinetic analysis
- Identification and clustering of kinetic folding pathways

## Repository Structure

### FeatureCalculation_and_MSM
